The average person can only type around 45 words per minute--this is slower than the average person can think. If you spend time with computers you can probably type faster than the average bear. With only a little practice it is very achievable to type as fast as you can think. However, ask yourself, at what speed can I edit text? This is a little different, usually you have to think harder when editing text and jump around from place to place instead of just streaming together thoughts. Editing is not a linear process and the normal linear input that a standard text editor gives you cannot accommodate this change. This is an egregious shortcoming of almost all modern text editors.

Preforming any task for a significant period of time can be exhausting, mentally or physically. A harrowing fact that one can realize is that they will spend a huge portion of their life interacting with text on a computer. Usually this comes form your profession; a few obvious ones come to mind such as programmers and writers, however, almost everyone has had to write a large portion of text at some point in time. Typing text is easy and most text editing software from Word to Notepad to VScode will give you essentially the same experience. However, editing the text that you just finished kills all momentum. Mental energy and time now must be expended navigating via a device that doesn't even write text (the dreaded ***mouse***). Another option is to utilize the arrow keys away from where you would normally rest your hands when writing text. Both of these disrupt the process of writing/editing, this energy should be wasted.

Economy of motion is the act of utilizing as little energy as possible when preforming a task. Usually this is discussed in the context of a physical task but can be expanded into a simple philosophy. Doing less to conserve energy while allow you to do more for longer or save for your strength for when you need it. For many of us, writing and editing text is mentally exhausting--while also being crucial to our work. Energy should be conserved, the economy of motion should be applied. The solution to this? **Vim-keybindings**.
