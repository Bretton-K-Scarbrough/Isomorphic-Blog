## Markdown 

I just sort of want to write right now and see how difficult and or easy it is for me to write and create content for this blog. Ideally the friction should be as little as possible. I gotta figure out how I want to compile mathematical content because I think that it will be important to me to do so. I really like the wave equation <Katex>u\_`{`ii`}` + \frac{1}`{`c^2`}`u\_`{`xx`}`=0</Katex>. This is a test, it has to be -- otherwise I can't go on. 


```python
print('Hello World')
```
