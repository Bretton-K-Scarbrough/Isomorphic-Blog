## Howdy
This is the first post, I hope of many. The purpose of this blog, for me, is to share interesting ideas I find about math, physics, engineering, and philosophy. I have had a burgeoning desire to create and share ideas relating to these topics for about a year now--right now is as good of a time as any to start. This blog serves as a place for me to explore these ideas. 
<br>

A blog serves as a public space for ideas, a place where projects are "for others", or at least for others to see. The alternative would be to create purely personal projects, which I have done in the past. Something I know about myself is that, I work significantly harder when other people are involved. I am more likely to finish projects and do them at a higher quality if someone else may see the project. Even if this blog sees no traffic at all, that is not the point. The fact that it is public is enough to motivate me to create higher quality content.
<br>

Another purpose for this blog is the fact that it will force me to write. I want to write for **two reasons**. One: writing forces you to articulate ideas explicitly--if you can't put a topic into words then you don't understand the topic well enough. 
Two: I have an aspiration currently to have a career in research. In the field of research, writing about technical subjects is plentiful, if not the entire career itself. Often academics spend just as much time, if not more time, writing papers than experimenting or simulating. Putting your understanding into words helps you find your weak points and allows you to combat them. I like writing, but I am not a great writer. However, with enough time in the saddle, I can become a great writer. 

## Inspirations
As a closing remark, I want to share a list of content creators who have not only educated and entertained me, but inspired me to create this blog. [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) is a Youtube channel that anybody who has a passion for mathematics, engineering, or physics is aware of. This channel is the reason that I fell in love with mathematics at the beginning of my college career, and has undoubtedly changed the trajectory of my life for the better. [Physics for the Birds](https://www.youtube.com/@physicsforthebirds) is a wonderful Youtube channel that creates content ranging from "Is Legend of Zelda Turing Complete?" to "The Statistics of Microwave Popcorn". The description of the channel is "I share things that I get excited about: math, physics, electronics, programming, music--anything that requires taking things apart.  *My goal is to explain it simply enough that any 4th grader will be inspired and rigorously enough that any professor will be convinced.*" This sentence is everything I aspire this blog to be. 
<br>

Though there are many more channels I would like to list in detail, simply going to their respective Youtube channels and watching their content could convince you of their value more than I could with words:

- [Struggling Grad Student](https://www.youtube.com/@PhDVlog777)
- [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate)
- [All Angles](https://www.youtube.com/@AllAnglesMath)

Thank you for your time,
